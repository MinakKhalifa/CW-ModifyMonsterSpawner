# Modify Monster Spawner

Try to survive in the old world with an increased number of monsters!

This mod allows you to change the frequency of monster spawning. It is with this mod you will be able to see all the monsters on the first quota, as this mod also changes the daily budget.

## BE CAREFUL!

If you set in the mod's config too many monsters, the game may hang or even crash.
